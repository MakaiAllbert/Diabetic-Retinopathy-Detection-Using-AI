# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-AI

Diabetic retinopathy detection using artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Diabetic retinopathy is a disease that results from complications of type I and type II diabetes, ultimately affecting patients eyes. =
The disease impacts the lives off 347 million people worldwide. The hope is that by using artificial intelligence and deeplearning, doctors will be able to detect blindness in patients before it occurs.

This project was inspired and guided by a course titled that same name on Coursera.org.
